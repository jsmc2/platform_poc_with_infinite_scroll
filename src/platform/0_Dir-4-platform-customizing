This folder holds the files for adapting and extending platform core for the needs of the apps.  
The code in in the files follows convention to inorder to interface with platform core.
In a more descriptive sense this folder might be call "app_platform", "my_platform", "customized_platform, etc.  
But "platform" is faster to type in import statments and looks 'cleaner'.
